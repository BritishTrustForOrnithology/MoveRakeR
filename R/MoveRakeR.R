#' MoveRakeR: An R package for loading, manipulating and analysing animal tracking data.
#'
#' The \code{MoveRakeR} package ('Move' = animal movement; 'Rake' = a sift through the data to check quality)
#' provides several categories of functions:
#' (1) reading in tracking data, carrying out (2) Data appraisal ('rake'), (3) basic data 'cleaning',
#' (4) manipulation, summary, trip-level simple analyses and (5) plotting tracks, prior to further analytical
#' adventures.
#'
#' The \code{MoveRakeR} package is primarily focused at the first stages of data manipulation and cleaning and has been
#' borne out of application of regular processing of tracking data on a variety of bird species. The \code{MoveRakeR} package is intended to support
#' the other existing workflows in other R packages, such as
#' \code{move} (Kranstauber et al. 2018) and \code{move2} (Kranstauber et al. 2024) and provides some further
#' tools to address common manipulations of data routinely
#' encountered that often require a degree of subjectivity in decision making. We also direct the reader to
#' check out \code{ExMove}, (Langley et al. 2024), \code{trip}, (Sumner 2009, Sumner et al. 2011)
#' and \code{AMT} (Signer et al. 2019) for further analyses and data manipulation. Of note, is that the \code{MoveRakeR} package is also
#' currently aimed at GPS data collected from bird-borne devices, rather than other positional telemetry systems such as Argos or geolocator tags.
#'
#' @section Reading in data:
#'
#' We provide a specific set of functions to source data from the University of Amsterdam Bird-tracking system (UvA-BiTS, Bouten et al. 2013) - see \url{https://www.uva-bits.nl/};
#' the primary function is \code{\link{read_track_UvA}} which links directly with the postGreSQL online database. This requires initial set up of the R ODBC database connection (see function help for information).
#' Further queries of that database are also made via functions to read in accelerometry data \code{\link{read_accn_UvA}} and
#' data from pressure sensors \code{\link{read_pressure_UvA}} and voltage information \code{\link{read_voltage_UvA}}; a specific function is also required for
#' plotting the voltage \code{plot.Vo}. It is often also helpful to query the UvA-BiTS database for TagIDs for the name of the repository and we
#' therefore provide. A function not currently available in \code{MoveRakeR} is for merging of accelerometer
#' classifications with \code{\link{Track}} data; this is not provided as it is considered up to the user how to do this but get in touch if this may be useful.
#'
#' It was not the task of \code{MoveRakeR} to fully replace any other work streams that source data from online repositories such as Movebank. However,
#' we provide a wrapper function \code{\link{read_track_MB}} to access Movebank repositories using the \code{move} package; this was to bring data
#' in line with the required layout for \code{MoveRakeR} and facilitated easy combining of Movebank and UvA-BiTS datasets.
#' This may be quite a niche issue, in which case direct use of the \code{move} or \code{move2} packages are recommended.
#'
#' For \code{MoveRakeR} data are required with a minimum of four columns: TagID, DateTime, longitude and latitude.
#' These can be coerced to an in-house \code{Track} object
#' for further generic plotting and summarising of the Track object class. The main format is a single data.frame object. listed
#' objects are sometimes used, which are then named \code{TrackStack} and \code{TrackMultiStack} class objects. However, it is
#' simpler to work with \code{data.frame} or \code{tibble} objects of a single dataset. These data objects can be of multiple animals. Movebank
#' data can also be coerced to a \code{Track} format using \code{move2Track} or \code{Track2move} for the inverse operation.
#'
#' On a specific note, the \code{MoveRakeR} package makes substantial use of the \code{tidyverse}, specifically using R packages
#' \code{dplyr}, \code{tibble} and \code{tidyr}. Given the aim of this package was to provide some useful tools,
#' we have sought to make the code contained within functions accessible if need be, to avoid code becoming a 'black-box' and
#' permit 'tidy' workflows (Langley et al. 2024). The {tidyverse} packages are used here to group data such as by TagID when carrying out specific tasks
#' requiring a grouping, although \code{MoveRakeR} does make substantial use of base R and data.table as well.
#'
#' @section Data quality and outlier checking ('raking'), and data 'cleaning':
#'
#' When a GPS dataset is obtained, as with any data, it requires scrutiny and assessment prior to further analyses
#' being conducted to address the research question at hand. However specifically for GPS telemetry data
#' well-known measurement and sampling errors can initially be appraised. Here, a subtle delineation is made within
#' \code{MoveRakeR} functions between:
#' (1) initial assessment of potential data errors as a data 'rake', analogous to dragging
#' a rake over the surface of some soil to uncover hidden issues, separate from:
#' (2) 'cleaning' the data, i.e. annotating/filtering the data more formally for removal of likely erroneous data.
#' Of course these two steps are not mutually exclusive.
#'
#' Regarding potential sources of error and bias, these may include dealing with duplicate records, missing (NA) location data, and constraining the amount of data per animal to
#' a certain number of records over set time periods. It may also be worthwhile checking out other packages such as the
#' \code{move2} package liaising directly with Movebank (Kranstauber et al. 2024) for these issues. Further consideration of a minimum number of fixes per animal
#' may be needed. These elements can be dealt with in open code, but are uncovered through the \code{\link{rake}} and \code{\link{clean_GPS}} functions.
#' A further Shiny app is also included \code{\link{ShinyRakeR}} that can be used to flag (i.e. annotate) the data for different perceived biases, helping to rake the data and
#' see how these issues may stack up in a final filtering overarching step. Within that same app, and also in the \code{rake} function, the
#' user can also check the timeline of tag deployments and density of animals tracked over time through \code{\link{tag_timeline}}, and therefore assess the temporal
#' spread of the tracking data and sample sizes over the study duration. Spatial or temporal outliers may be rather obvious by eye, and
#' these can also be assessed in the \code{rake} function or through direct use of the \code{\link{tag_spans}} function for proportion of data per tag
#' that may be erroneous from an a priori expectation of spatio-temporal coverage.
#'
#' It is also important to assess the degree of location error and potential bias present in the data.
#' GPS locations (xy horizontal dimension) may be subject to positional errors that arise from a number of sources; for example signal interference,
#' obstruction (e.g. buildings, trees), interference signals, configuration and number of satellites in the sky,
#' communication with the satellites, atmospheric conditions, and the 'start' of the tag i.e. cold-start/warm start,
#' also to sampling rate of data collection for the GPS sensor. The \code{MoveRakeR} does not unpick all of these drivers specifically, but
#' draws attention to the resultant errors that may impact the data collected. Fewer satellites used for a fix may result increase the error in
#' location (minimum of three for a valid xy position and four for a vertical position) and therefore a minimum threshold of satellites
#' available for a fix may be useful to consider. If information on satellite configuration position in the sky is
#' available (DOP) then this may be worth examining. GPS can sometimes give highly inaccurate
#' locations that are clearly impossible for the animal to have obtained, removed in a consecutive way, through the \code{\link{speed_filt}} function
#' and in turn within \code{ShinyRakeR} and \code{clean_GPS} so that
#' displacement of such fixes are also captured. There are a variety of further R packages that also have other speed filter methods, such as the \code{trip}
#' package. Nevertheless, the approach is to use a maximum travel speed for the animal beyond which fixes are deemed impossible and would therefore be erroneous.
#' This may be complicated however, for very fine-scale (or perhaps very coarse) movements, so the sampling rate of the tag may also need considering
#' - see function \code{\link{tspeed_jit}}.
#'
#' \code{MoveRakeR} also offers a simple assessment of potentially outlying data through the \code{\link{rake_outlie}} function. This can be useful to inform if
#' such biases without treatment/consideration could have an impact on further data processing and analyses further down the line.
#' This of course is highly dependent on the research question or intended use of data, as GPS error may be of key interest in
#' itself, with methods available to model such sources of error and understand why they occur, such as continuous-time or behavioural movement
#' modelling (R package \code{momentuHMM}, McClintock & Michelot 2018). However, there are cases where an appraisal and filtering
#' i.e. 'cleaning' of the data for less accurate/precise information is needed. For example, a summary of 'foraging trips' of animals
#' or time spent away from a central place may be all that is required, that benefits from removing GPS locations that may be clearly incorrect and their
#' retention would distort movement metrics. Basic area utilisation methods may also benefit from such treatment.
#' Among other R packages, \code{ctmm} can consider location error and trajectory speed estimates directly for detecting outliers (Flemming et al. 2020) -
#' see function \code{ctmm::outlie}.
#'
#' Another key source of sampling bias in tracking data is that data collected may be interrupted, for example due to battery depletion, causing hiatuses in the
#' recording. Visual assessment of the data 'gaps' between GPS locations in date-time per animal can be useful to identify these patterns, achievable both
#' in the \code{ShinyRakeR} app and also for UvA-BiTS data through plotting a voltage data class in \code{plot.Vo}. The \code{MoveRakeR} workflow is centred upon
#' annotation of the dataset to flag up such 'gapiness' and prevent calculations being made across timespans the user considers to be uncharacteristic of a continuous monvement pattern.
#' These gaps in deployments can be viewed/detected at the day-level within \code{tag_timeline}. Having these strings of fixes identified id useful as a large temporal gap
#' may have missed a considerable amount of activity of the animal, particularly if distance-based metrics such as total distance
#' travelled are concerned. The function \code{\link{gap_section}} specifies the gap to label in the data; this gap definition is also allowed in \code{clean_GPS}. Additional operations
#' such as consideration of what to do with such isolated fixes resulting from placement as a single gapsection are also provided, which is also available for consideration in the \code{ShinyRakeR} interactive tool.
#'
#' @section Manipulation, summary, trip-level simple analyses:
#'
#' Another common task is to filter (or downgrade) the data from a finer temporal sampling rate to a coarser one. This has many applications such as
#' aligning data within and among animals across varying sampling rates, dealing with statistical issues such as temporal autocorrelation (e.g. Davies et al. 2024), or perhaps simply
#' one fix every x time unit is required for a particular reason. data can of course be interpolated and there are many great R packages now available to
#' consider continuous time movement modelling process such as \code{crawl} (Johnson et al. 2008), \code{ctmm} (Fleming & Calabrese 2023) and \code{aniMotum} (Jonsen et al. 2023)
#' or simple linear interpolation over space and time \code{adehabitatLT} (Calenge 2006).
#' The \code{adehabitatLT} package is used within \code{MoveRakeR} for some simple computations using the \code{adehabitatLT::as.ltraj} function.
#' Where estimation of presence in space via a modelled approach is not desired however, filtering steps are commonly used. other R packages are available
#' for this as well such as: \code{move}, (Kranstauber et al. 2018) \code{trip} (Sumner et al. 2009, Sumner 2011), \code{ExMove} (Langley et al. 2024). However, here we build on these to consider some quirks encountered in
#' conducting filtering. A fundamental consideration is how to perform the filtering, which could be rounding the DateTimes to a regular
#' time unit, such as every minute, hour etc, or whether this should be conducted from the start time of the animal(s) rather than by the clock as such. More
#' importantly however, the sampling process can be considered quite reductionist and selective for specific fixes at the same rounding units. We therefore also
#' provide a novel sub-sampling approach to randomise this process; this is particularly useful to make maximal use of the data and important when an animal is traversing a
#' unit of space only once, such as on migration (Schwemmer et al. 2021). The function \code{\link{sub_samp}} provides these additional capabilities.
#'
#' Beyond the basic cleaning and filtering stages above, further annotation of the data is often required for central place foraging consideration. As mentioned above,
#' metrics for an animal or population may be needed to assess how far typically animals move from their central place, how long trips are, and other metrics
#' such as tortuosity, bearing, total distance and probably many others. This links back to how suitable the GPS data are for feeding into these movement metrics and where such cut-offs should be to avoid biased estimates.
#'
#' Ideally, 'trips' need annotation in the data directly and \code{MoveRakeR} uses a tidy approach, as recommended by the \code{ExMove} toolkit, to achieve this. These processes
#' are provided as a function \code{\link{define_trips}} to remove repetition of code and permitting definitions of a central place such as a radius, rectangle or polygon around a central colony point,
#' or use of specific nest locations for individual animals; on the latter, nest locations may be known directly or perhaps where not, estimates from other
#' approaches such as nestR (Picardi et al. 2020) or recurse (Bracis et al. 2019) may be informative, or alternatively a single colony location may be provided. These locations are needed by the function
#' to estimate where to measure the trip start/end point in space and time. The function \code{\link{trip_stats}} can then be used to generate movement metric summaries
#' of trips for each animal and the group of animals. Further tabulation functions are provided such as \code{tabulate_trips} which takes
#' the output from \code{trip_stats} and summarise the information neatly, such as for reporting purposes. Please note
#' that complexities can arise when manipulating data between the use of \code{define_trips} and \code{trip_stats} functions that could result
#' in a loss of a required attribute relating to trips that share a common start and end DateTime, which can be handled through adding
#' needed data rows using \code{add_cag_trips} back into the data.
#'
#' The sampling 'rate' of GPS tags may be known of course by the user, but if not, these can be estimated by simple binning of the data. This is a typically
#' trivial task, but a separate function \code{\link{assign_rates}} is provided to assist.
#'
#' In should also be noted that at present the vertical information from GPS tags is not the primary focus of \code{MoveRakeR},
#' although highly relevant and with potentially overlapping processing steps.
#'
#' @section Visualising data:
#'
#' As noted above the \code{ShinyRakeR} Shiny application can be used to visualise data for 'raking' and 'cleaning' purposes.
#' This is totally up to the user of course, but some further built-in plotting aids have been coded into \code{MoveRakeR} using \code{leaflet}
#' as smaller \code{shiny} applications. Specifically one for overall visualisation is called \code{\link{plot_leaflet}}
#' and one for once foraging trips have been defined on the data call \code{\link{plot_leaflet_trips}}, the latter which can help visualise
#' specific trips, distances travelled over time and in relation to the overall distribution and so forth. Further a generic \code{plot.Track}
#' S3 method is available if the data is coerced to a \code{Track} format. Additionally, \code{plot.Vo} is a further plot generic for voltage objects for
#' UvA-BiTS data. A separate R package is available for visualisation called \code{RakeRvis}, see \href{https://github.com/BritishTrustForOrnithology/RakeRvis}{here}.
#' This \code{RakeRvis} package is in development and uses \code{leaflet}, \code{leafgl} and \code{mapdeck}
#' for a more elaborate visualisations, including palette choices, plotting animal data by other gradients of covariates in the data and other animations.
#'
#' @section Other:
#'
#' An S3 generic print method is coded into \code{MoveRakeR} for giving a 'pretty' output in the R console, and a \code{summary} function
#' is provided that gives a very simple overview of the data such as number of fixes per animal, start and end periods of
#' data, for which there is further control over \code{set_options_mR}.
#'
#' The overall class of object for \code{MoveRakeR} is a \code{Track} object but functions are not strict in requiring this format, only the
#' named data columns as mentioned earlier. However functions for making a \code{Track} are present, as well as further listed formats of \code{TrackStack}
#' and \code{TrackMultiStack} (double listed).
#'
#' Further functions for GIS-based assessments are also available for working out offshore GPS fixes compared to terrestrial ones using the \code{offshore} function,
#' and determining the distance to coast using the \code{dist2coast} function; these function add additional columns of offshore and dist2coast to the the data
#' having ingested a shapefile to make the determination. These, however, are broad GIS tasks though manageable outside of \code{MoveRakeR} and are not central to this
#' pipeline. This is also perhaps more specific to certain taxa, with this task being borne out
#' of gull-specific work where birds were moving over terrestrial and marine environments, requiring distinction in foraging trips. In the present package
#' release these functions are note dovetailed into the trip process but this is being updated.
